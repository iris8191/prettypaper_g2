      "the grid computing and cloud computing environments. \n",
      "Despite its growing significance, the quality of accounting \n",

      "of user behavior. To address the above problem, an accounting \n",

      "Grid[1] is a promising computing paradigm for large \n",
      "scale distributed system. Taking the advantage of the \n",
      "Internet, grid middleware integrates distributed resources, \n",
      "facilitating resource sharing and collaboration. With the \n",
      "rapid development of grid computing technology, more and \n",
      "more users participate in the grid. The grid aims to process \n",
      "a large number of jobs. Efficiently recording the amount of \n",
      "grid resources consumed by jobs can not only learn about \n",
      "users’ contribution and consumption of grid resources, but \n",
      "also help to predict resource consumption in the near future. \n",
      "Besides that, it will help system administrator to analyse \n",
      "system performance bottlenecks, and find out appropriate \n",
      "measures to reduce the waste and unreasonable use of \n",
      "resources. The formulation of accounting strategy and \n",
      "pricing model is related to grid accounting, the more \n",
      "important for accounting is the extraction of accounting \n",
      "informations, that is efficient and accurate statistics and \n",
      "records of the comsumptions of varietys of accounting \n",
      "resources by grid jobs, such as CPU times, Memory space, \n",
      "Disk space, etc. Therefore, the extraction of accounting \n",
      "information is a key part in the accounting model. \n",
      "Accounting system is the key module in the grid \n",
      "middleware as well as in the cloud environment[2], it’s also \n",
      "an integral part. Unfortunately, in the existing grid and \n",
      "cloud computing accounting systems, there are some \n",
      "problems, including accounting methods and accounting log \n",
      "files are too tightly coupled, slow updates, and ignoring the \n",
      "impact of user behavior. In order to solves these problems, \n",
      "an accounting model based on event-trigged mechanism \n",
      "and user behavior is proposed. An event-trigged mechanism \n",
      "method was used to collect the accounting information. The \n",
      "model also introduces an accounting policy based on users’ \n",
      "behavior. In this policy, the user behavior in the grid is \n",
      "evaluated, and the user's weight factor is computed, and the \n",
      "user could be get rewarded and punished accordingly in the \n",
      "process. A prototype for evaluating the proposed \n",
